# persistent-stratified
This project provides a collection of functions that can be used
to approximate stratifications and determine persistent stratified homotopy types from point cloud data 
as introduced by MÃ¤der and Waas in their paper 'From Samples to Persistent Stratified Homotopy Types'.

## How to use the code
This project is intended to provide possible implementation of the mathematical concepts described in
our theoretical work. For a complete picture of the mathematics behind see the paper. In order to give
a quick start how to use some of the functionality of this program code we included an example application
based on local homology with Example.cpp. To see how to further process the output for visualisation we 
chose to make a short python script available here, see LocCoH_plot.py.
Furthermore, we hope this collection of program code can serve as a strating point for somebody interested
in the application of topological methods for the investigation of stratified spaces arising in real-world data.
